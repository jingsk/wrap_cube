# wrap_cube
shift both atomic positions and volume data consistently along the voxel grid.
If you are like me, and perform lots of periodic electronic structure calculations of low dimensional materials, you have made a density/wf cube file that has atoms wrapped around to the other side of the unit cell because of periodic boundary condition. Instead of making a supercell to visualize your atoms, volume, use this script to shift both atoms and the density along the voxel grid.
